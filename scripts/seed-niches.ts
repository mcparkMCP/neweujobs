Over 47% of residents are foreign nationals, and more than 200,000 cross-border workers commute daily from France, Belgium, and Germany — making Luxembourg one of the most international labour markets anywhere.\n\nThe EU institutional presence is substantial. Luxembourg hosts the European Court of Justice (CJEU), the European Investment Bank (EIB), the European Court of Auditors (ECA), Eurostat, the Publications Office of the EU, and parts of the European Commission and Parliament secretariats. These institutions employ thousands of officials, contract agents, and trainees, with salaries adjusted by a Luxembourg correction coefficient that reflects the high cost of living.\n\nLuxembourg's financial sector is its economic powerhouse. The country is Europe's leading centre for investment funds (UCITS), hosts over 120 banks, and is home to major players including the European Investment Fund, Clearstream, and the headquarters of ArcelorMittal — the world's largest steel company. Big Four firms (Deloitte, PwC, EY, KPMG) have large offices here, and fintech is growing rapidly with companies like PayPal, Amazon Payments, and Rakuten choosing Luxembourg as their European base.\n\nSalaries in Luxembourg are among the highest in Europe. The minimum wage exceeds €2,500/month (the EU's highest), financial sector salaries are highly competitive, and EU institution packages include generous benefits. Luxembourg also offers significant tax advantages: favourable personal tax rates, no wealth tax on securities, and special regimes for highly skilled expatriates.\n\nThe working environment is genuinely multilingual. Most professionals operate in English, French, and sometimes German daily. Luxembourgish is the national language but is rarely required in the international workplace. French is essential for daily life — shopping, housing, and administration.\n\nQuality of life is exceptional. Luxembourg City is safe, green, and compact.
